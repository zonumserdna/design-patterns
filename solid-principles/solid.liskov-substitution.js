/** Liskov Substitution principle (LSP)
 * 
 * Barbara Liskov
 * 
 * The idea under this principle is that if you have some method which takes some
 * base type, it should also equally be able to take derived type
 * 
 * Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a superclass should be
 * replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application. In
 * other words, what we want is to have the objects of our subclasses behaving the
 * same way as the objects of our superclass.
 * 
 * Let's imagine that first we had a RectangleBad class and then we decided to introduce
 * a new concept called SquareBad, but whenever working with SquareBad, you want to enforce
 * that the square always has the same width and height, so it is going to extends
 * RectangleBad but it is going to have a different constructor.
 * The problem is that id you assume that the square height and width are always the same,
 * you have to enforce it somehow because otherwise what I can do is something like create
 * a new SquareBad which size is 5, log this which give as a nice 5x5 square, next we decided
 * change width to 10, which give us a wrong 10x5 square, strictly speaking it's no longer a
 * square, it is a rectangle but its type is still a square.
 * 
 * How can we fix this?
 * 
 * Well, one really dangerous way of fixing this problem would be to rewrite both rectangle
 * as well as square to use getters and setters instead of just ordinary fields as we are.
 * So we put everything into sort of underscore with and underscore height and then what we would
 * do is we would actually make getters and setters accordingly. So whe we modify the square it
 * always keeps itself as square since the setters sets both width and height, this might seem like
 * really good way of keeping a square as opposed to have the square magically turning into a
 * rectangle while still being a square.
 * 
 * What is the problem?
 * 
 * It is that you can have functions which work with a base class rectangle but it failed completely
 * with a derived class as square.
 * 
 * We essentially broken the useIt function but the function should work well since it takes a
 * a rectangle, then it should be able to take any inheritor of rectangles such as a square
 * and that is the point of LSP
 * 
 * The risk of LSP says that
 * 
 * If you have a function which takes a base class it should be able to take a derived class
 * without breaking the functionality
 * 
 * Sometimes you can introduce a derived class which breaks existing functionality
 * 
 * So inherit Square from rectangle is entirely wrong.
 * 
 * To make a square then maybe there is a factory method that we can make, it is just a possibility
