Strategy
    - System behavior partially specified at runtime
    - Many algorithms can be decomposed into higher- and lower-level parts
    - Making tea can be decomposed into:
        - The process of making a hot beverage (boil water, pour into cup); and
        - Tea-specific things (put teabag into water)
    - The high-level algorithm can then be reused to making coffee or hot chocolate (low level implementations)
        - Supported by beverage-specific strategies
    Enables the exact behavior of a system to be selected at run-time

Summary
    - Define an algorithm at a high level
    - Define the interface you expect each strategy to follow
    - Provide for dynamic composition of strategies in the resulting object
