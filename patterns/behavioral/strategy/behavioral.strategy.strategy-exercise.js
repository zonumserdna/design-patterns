/*
Strategy Coding Exercise
A creature is walking through the dungeon. It is expected to have the following attributes:

- attack is its attack value
- health is its health value
- alive indicates whether the creature is alive or not

The creature is part of a game that involves traps. When a creature springs a trap, two things can happen:

- In a ConstantDamageStrategy, the creature's health is reduced by exactly 1 (one) point. So if a creature had 5 health and it springs a trap, it now has 4 health.
- In a GrowingDamageStrategy, each spring trap does 1 more damage to the creature than the previous one. So the creature takes 1 damage on the first trap, 2 on the second, 3 on the third, and so on.

Please help complete the implementation of both Creature and associated strategies using the provided implementation.
