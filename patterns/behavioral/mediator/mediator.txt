Mediator
    - Facilitates communication between components.
    - Is a component that facilitates communication between other components without them necessarily being
      aware of each other having direct (reference) access to each other
    - it is a kind of half connected scenario

Motivation
    - System with many components
    - Components may go in and out of a system at any time
        - Chat room with participants (participants come and go)
        - Players in a game
    - It makes no sense for them to have direct references to one another
        - Those references may go dead at any time
    - Solution: have them all refer to some central component that facilitates communication

Summary
    - Create the mediator and have each object in the system refer to it
    - Mediator engages in bidirectional communication with its connected components
    - Mediator has functions the components can call
    - Components have functions the mediator can call
