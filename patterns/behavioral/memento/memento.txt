Memento
    - Keep a memento of an object's state to return to that state
    - Is a token/handle representing the system state. Lets us roll back to the state when the token was generated. May or
      may not directly expose state information. 

Motivation
    - An object or system goes through changes
        - A bank account gets deposits and withdrawals
    - There are different ways to navigate those changes
    - One way is to record every change (Command) and teach a command to 'undo' itself
    - Another is to simply save snapshots of the system (MEMENTO)

Summary
    - Mementos are used to roll back states arbitrarily
    - A memento is simply a token/handle class with (typically) no functions of its own
    - A memento is not required to expose the state(s) to which it reverts the system
    - Can be used to implement undo/redo operations
