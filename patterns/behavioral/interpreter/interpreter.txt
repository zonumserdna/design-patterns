Interpreter
    - Interpreters are all around us, even now
    - Textual input needs to be processed
        E.g., turned into OOP structures
    - Some examples
        - Programming language compilers, interpreters IDEs
        - HTML, XML and similar
        - Numeric expressions (3+4/5)
        - Regular expressions
    - Turning strings into OOP based structures is a complicated process

    A component that processes structured text data. Does so by turning it into a
    separate lexical tokens (lexing) and then interpreting sequences of said
    tokens (parsing).

    Summary:
        - Barring simple cases, an interpreter acts in two stages (lexing, parsing)
        - Lexing turns text into a set of tokens
        - Parsing takes the tokens into a meaningful constructs
        - Parsed data can then be traversed
