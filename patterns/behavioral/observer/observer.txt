Observer
    - I am watching you
    - We need to be informed when certain things happen
        - Object's property changes
        - Object does something
        - Some external event occurs
    - We want to listen to events and be notified when they occur
        - Notifications should include useful data
    - We want to unsubscribe from events if we're no longer interested
    
    An observer is an object that wishes to be informed about events happening in the system. The entity generating the events is an observable

Summary
    - Observer is an intrusive approach: an observable must provide an event to subscribe to
    - Subscription and unsubscription handled with addition/removal of items in a list
    - Property notifications are easy; dependent property notifications are tricky
