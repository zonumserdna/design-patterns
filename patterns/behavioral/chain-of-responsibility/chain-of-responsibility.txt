Chain of responsibility
    Sequence of handlers processing an event one after the other.
    A chain of components who all get a chance to process a command or a query, optionally
    having the default processing implementation and the ability to terminate the processing chain.

Motivation
    - Unethical behavior by an employee; who takes the blame?
        - Employee
        - Manager
        - CEO
    - You click a graphical element on a form
        - Button handles it, stops further processing
        - Underlying group box
        - Underlying window
    - Computer game
        - Creature has attacked and defense values
        - Those can be boosted bu other cards

Command Query Separation (CQS)
    - Command: asking for an action or change (e.g., please set your value to 2)
    - Query: asking for information (e.g., please give me your attack value).
    - CQS: having separate means of sending commands and queries to e.g., direct field access.

Summary
    - Can be implemented as a chain of references or a centralized construct
    - Enlist objects in the chain, possibly controlling their order/priority
    - In a linked-list implementation, one member can impede further processing
    - Support removal of objects from the chain (lifetime control)
