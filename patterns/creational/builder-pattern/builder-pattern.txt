Motivation
    - Some objects are simple to create and can be created in a single initializer call
    - Other objects require a lot of ceremony to create which means that you build up the object
      in stages and it takes a lot of time and you might be tempted to create a large initializer
    - Having an object with 10 different initializer arguments is not productive
    - Instead we opt for piecewise construction: what happens is you call different methods of a
      special component called builder
    - Builder provides an API for constructing an object step-by-step

Builder
    - When piecewise object construction is complicated, provide an API for doing it succinctly
    - Something that helps to build a particular object

Summary
  - A builder is a separate component for building an object
  - Can either give builder an initializer or return it via a static function
  - To make builder fluent, return self
  - Different Facets of an object can be built with different builders working in tandem via a
    base class
