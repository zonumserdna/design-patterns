Facade
    Exposing several components through a single interface.
    Provides a simple, easy to understand user interface over a large and sophisticated body of code.

Motivation
    - We typically want to balance complexity and presentation/usability
    - Typical home
        - Many subsystems (electrical, sanitation)
        - Complex internal structure (floor, layers)
        - End user is not exposed to internals
    - Same with software
        - Many systems working to provide flexibility
        - API consumers want it "just to work"

Summary
    - Build a Facade to provide simplified API over a set of classes
    - May wish to (optionally) expose internals through the Facade
    - May allow users to "escalate" to use more complex APIs if they need to.
