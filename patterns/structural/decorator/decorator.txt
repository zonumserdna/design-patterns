Motivation
    - Augment an object with additional functionality
    - Do not want to rewrite or alter existing code (OCP)
    - Want to keep new functionality separate (SRP)
    - Need to be able to interact with existing structures
    - 2 options
        - Inherit from required object (if possible)
        - Build a decorator, which simply references the decorated object(s)

Decorator
    Facilitates the addition of behaviors to individual objects without inheriting from them.

Summary
    - A decorator keeps the reference to the connected objet(s)
    - Adds utility fields and methods to augment the object's features
    - May or may not forward calls to the underlying object
