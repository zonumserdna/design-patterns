Flyweight
    A space optimization technic that lets us use less memory by storing
    externally the data associated with similar objects.

Motivation
    - Avoid redundancy when storing data
    - E.g., Massive multiplayer (MMORPG)
        - Plenty of users with identical first/last names
        - No sense in storing same first/last names over and over again
        - Better option is to store a list of names and reference to them
    - E.g., bold or italic text formatting in text editor
        - Don't want each character to have a formatting character
        - Operate on ranges (e.g., line number, start/end positions)

Summary
    - Store common data externally
    - Specify an index or a reference into the external data store
    - Define the idea of "ranges" on homogeneous collections and store data
      related to those ranges
